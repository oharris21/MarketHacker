# MarketHacker

I made MarketHacker to get more practice using Spring to build web apps, to brush up on the newest version of Angular, and also because I am fascinated by the potential of the stock market.

Note: The third party API I was consuming for up-to-the-minute stock data was expensive and I cancelled my subscription after I got this working. It is not currently deployed since there is no data coming in without the use of that API.
