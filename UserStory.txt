 *** BACK END ***
 - write tests for CustomStockBuilder methods
 

*** STRETCH GOALS ***
- back end logic that calculates the best price range to sell at. Basically the inverse of the resistance level calculator. 

- front end logic that finds the difference of the two and takes in input for how many shares and gives you a "profit 
estimate" 

- stock doesn't have a dip, but has been accumulating in a strong support level for the last five minutes
